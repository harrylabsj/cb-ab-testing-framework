# Overseas A/B Testing Design Framework

## Overview

This skill provides a structured framework for designing culturally aware experiments when entering or operating in overseas markets. It recognizes that what works in your home market may not transfer, and that running experiments without accounting for cultural, seasonal, and segmentation differences can produce misleading results. The framework covers turning vague growth hypotheses into testable ones, mapping which localization variables to isolate, designing sample and segmentation logic appropriate for each market, building bias and seasonality checklists, creating a learning interpretation template, and maintaining a prioritized experiment backlog.

The framework is designed for growth teams, product managers, UX researchers, ecommerce operators, and data-informed marketers.

## When to Use

- You are running A/B tests in a new overseas market and want to ensure they are properly designed
- Your home-market tests have been producing results that do not replicate when you apply them overseas
- You want to build a systematic experiment backlog for international markets rather than running ad-hoc tests
- You are planning localization changes and want to know which variables to test and how
- You need to convince stakeholders that a result from one market should or should not be applied to another

## Inputs to Collect

1. **Growth objective:** what specific business outcome you are trying to move (conversion rate, signup rate, average order value, retention)
2. **Hypothesis or observation:** what you have noticed that you believe could be improved (e.g., "our landing page conversion in Germany is lower than expected")
3. **Market(s):** which markets are in scope for this experiment
4. **Current baseline metrics:** existing conversion rates, traffic volumes, and seasonality patterns in each target market
5. **Localization changes under consideration:** what specific changes you are planning (headline translation, visual adaptation, CTA button change, pricing display, trust badge placement)
6. **Traffic and sample availability:** estimated weekly visitors per market, which determines how long tests need to run
7. **Team analytics capability:** whether you have access to analytics support for statistical significance calculations and results interpretation

## Workflow

1. Turn the overseas growth question into a falsifiable hypothesis that states the market, audience, variable, expected behavior change, rationale, and decision threshold.
2. Choose localization variables deliberately, separating language, creative, imagery, proof point, offer, price display, trust signal, onboarding step, payment message, and support promise.
3. Design the experiment structure with market segmentation, sample-size caveats, traffic source control, timing rules, guardrail metrics, and a plan for qualitative interpretation when samples are small.
4. Prepare a bias and validity checklist covering seasonality, translation quality, novelty effects, mixed audiences, device differences, paid-channel skew, and accidental cross-market averaging.
5. Translate the result into market-specific next actions, including scale, retest, localize deeper, narrow the segment, or reject the assumption, without assuming a winner should be copied globally.

## Output Modules

1. **Experiment Hypothesis Builder** — template and three example hypotheses for the target market
2. **Localization Variable Map** — categorized list of variables to consider, with the primary test variable identified
3. **Sample and Market Segmentation Logic** — sample size calculator template, segmentation approach, and traffic quality checks
4. **Bias and Seasonality Checklist** — pre-analysis checklist with documentation format
5. **Learning Interpretation Template** — completed template structure for recording results and decisions
6. **Experiment Backlog Prioritization** — scoring rubric and backlog format for managing experiments across markets

## Example Prompts

- "We ran a test in the US where changing our CTA button from gray to green increased conversions by 15%. Can we run the same test in Japan and expect the same result?"
- "Our landing page has a different conversion rate in Germany versus Brazil even though we have not changed anything. Help us design an experiment to understand why."
- "We want to test whether translating our testimonials into local language increases trust in Southeast Asia. How should we design this test?"
- "We have a list of 20 localization changes we want to test. How do we prioritize which to run first?"

## Safety and Limitations

This framework provides experiment design guidance, not statistical certification. High-stakes decisions (large budget reallocations, permanent product changes, market entry decisions) should not be made on the basis of low-sample or single-test results. Consult analytics or statistics experts for decisions with significant financial or strategic impact. Results from one market should not be automatically generalized to another market without explicit validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Turns vague growth observations into structured, falsifiable test hypotheses with a clear primary variable
- Separates language, offer, creative, and trust-signal variables and identifies which to test independently
- Includes risk controls for small sample sizes, seasonality, and external events in each target market
- Provides a prioritization matrix for the experiment backlog using impact, effort, confidence, and learning criteria
- Prevents overgeneralizing one-market results to other markets with explicit cross-market validation requirements
